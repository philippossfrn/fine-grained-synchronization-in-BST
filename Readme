It's simulating how a shared music streaming system works. Producers upload
and delete songs from BST. All producers(threads) have access to the same tree 
but controlled from pthreads library (barriers and locks).

Features:

- BST is implemented using fine grained synchronization algorithm
- Simultaneously access to BST from all threads
- Using barriers and locks to control them.
- Usig unbounded Queues with locks

Useful algorithms to use:

- BST Search
- BST Delete
- BST Insert
- Dequeue
- Enqueue

Running Instructions:

- compile using "make all" command
- then run command "./exec X" X=custom number of threads(producers to use)
e.g ./exec 4
